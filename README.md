Android_Space_Game
Hi guys, I'm Ezephra and this is my first Android project, a SPACE GAME!!!
I use github just for backup, 'cuz lately my laptop isn't working well and I don't like to start all over again.
If anyone is reading this, then there is a question for you: "Where can I find textures (2D, pixel art) free to use? (and yes also for comercial use)

I'm still a newbie, but I appreciate your help.

Kind regards

Ezephra
